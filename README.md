#### Welcome to My Portfolio
This portfolio is designed to be aesthetically pleasing, easy to navigate and scaffolded for addition of future projects. You will find name, recent photo, projects and contact information along with a PDF of a current resume. Each link in the navigation scrolls to the corresponding section. In the projects section, each image links to the project website or application and includes a brief description of the project name and languages used. This website is also formatted to be responsive to various screens and devices, adapting to the user viewpoint.
